In this mini-project i build a simple currency converter app using JavaScript and Bootstrap 5 for the ui. 
It will convert lek to euros, dollars and pounds. This is pure vanilla JavaScript with no JS libraries or frameworks.

P.S: currency values are taken in the moment that this project was builded.
